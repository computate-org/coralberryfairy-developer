        Bash Kernel for Jupyter
      </div>
      <p>
        For the rest of the course we will be running terminal commands directly from a Jupyter Notebook in VSCode. 
        For this you will want to install the Bash Kernel for Jupyter. 
        This is easy to install with python pip dependencies. 
        Open a terminal on your computer and run the commands below to install the Bash Kernel for Jupyter. 
      </p>
      {{ code('pip3 install bash_kernel
python3 -m bash_kernel.install') }}
      <p>
        If you have previously installed VSCode, you will want to close VSCode and reopen it to load the Bash Kernel.

        Developing software is not easy without the right tools. 
        Although I've worked for years with other IDEs like Eclipse, 
        the new standard for software development of all kinds is VSCode.

        VSCode makes it very easy to install very useful plugins. 
        Here is a list of plugins we will be using to develop your new data-driven website and API. 
        Install the following plugins which will be used for the rest of the course.
