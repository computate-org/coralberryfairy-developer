# Installing Python prerequisites

## Install Python VirtualEnv

```python
pip3 install virtualenv
```

Install a new python VirtualEnv


```python
virtualenv ~/.local/opt/python
ls ~/.local/opt/python/bin/python
```

Update your ~/.bashrc to use the new Python VirtualEnv


```python
which python
echo "source ~/.local/opt/python/bin/activate" | tee -a ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
which python
```

## Install prerequisite Python packages for Ansible

Whenever I install Ansible, I find there are some required Python dependencies. Install the `setuptools_rust` and `wheel` Python dependencies below. 


```python
pip3 install setuptools_rust wheel
```

## Upgrade pip the python package manager

Next upgrade pip, the python package manager for the latest python package support. 


```python
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

## Install Ansible automation tools

Ansible is the enterprise open source standard tool for automating everything on the computer. In my opinion, if you are automating your computers and cloud environments without Ansible, you are doing it wrong. Install the latest ansible software with python pip, as well as other important python dependencies like `kubernetes`, `openshift`, and `jmespath` which are required to automate OpenShift deployments. Then check that the `ansible-playbook` command is available to run. 


```python
pip3 install ansible kubernetes openshift jinja2 jmespath pika jinja2 --upgrade
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general --upgrade
which ansible-playbook
```
